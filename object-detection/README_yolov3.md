# Object detection with YOLOv3 model and Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit

This tutorial uses a TensorFlow* implementation of YOLOv3 model for object detection using the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit with two key components: Model Optimizer and Inference Engine.

Model Optimizer is a cross-platform command-line tool that takes pre-trained deep learning models and optimizes them for performance/space using conservative topology transformations. Inference engine provides a common API to deploy the deep learning model on hardware of choice.
